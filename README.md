# n8n Dockerfile with FFmpeg Support

A custom Dockerfile for n8n that includes FFmpeg support (other packages can also be added!)

This was tested with the n8n with workers template https://railway.com/deploy/r2SNX_

## Quick Start

1. Go to your n8n worker service settings tab and disconnect the DockerHub image
2. Connect your repository containing your Dockerfile (or use this repo directly)
3. Deploy and start automating! 🎉
